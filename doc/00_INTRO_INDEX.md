# hbdna-edit documentations

The following documentation may be consulted on-line from this github.<br>
When it will be more complete, the different on-line sections will be consolidated in a all-in-one pdf file.<br>

Documentation is detailed and have been written so that part of it could be used as a tutorial regarding USB devices understanding or integration, pyusb programming, and probably some other topics it will progress.

Here are the currently available sections :

1. [QualifyingtheUSBdeviceonLinux](01_QualifyingtheUSBdeviceonLinux.pdf)<br>
How to qualify and find important system and USB informations.

2. [System and Security settings](./02_SystemandSecuritysettings.pdf)<br>
